Science and policy are important activities that involve analysis and inference, but while science is about knowing, policy is about doing. If there's a decision to be made, a policy should use the best science available. In doing analysis for policy, we can't expect the same level of certainty that is required for publication in peer reviewed journals. The question is not whether the evidence is strong enough to support a strong conclusion, but what course of action is best supported by the evidence. A decision will get made, even if the evidence supporting a decision is weak. The core difference between inference for science and policy is how we weigh the uncertainty. 

While it may be unreasonable to be certain about any decisions we make, it is reasonable to expect a high level of rigor. We are developing an inferential framework for policy under the banner of **robust analytics.** The general notion of robust analysis is that a conclusion would not change if the analysis had been done in a reasonable but slightly different way. Robust policy advice is based on that same notion. Robust analytics are about characterizing and quantifying uncertainty, and then propagating that uncertainty through an analysis with the goal of giving policy advice. Ideally, while robust advice includes a recommended course of action, it would also include a discussion of alternative policies that would be nearly equally good.  Robust advice could be tenuous, but is well-supported. 

The natural complement to robust analytics is **adaptive management.** The focus is not on populations and policies affecting populations, not medicine and medical decision making. The domain of adaptive management is the set of policies and decisions implemented by national ministries of health. Since health policies are made and adjusted on monthly, annual, or multi-year cycles, it's possible to learn from a decision and adapt. The possibility of *learning from a policy* asks us to think about how evidence *could* change our minds about something, and we need the concepts and methods to support it. Ideally, robust policy advice would include a prioritized list of data gaps that could be filled to reduce uncertainty the next time a decision must be made. Robust analytics and adaptive management ask us to think carefully about the *value of information.*  

This website -- *Health Analytics for Robust Policy* -- is designed as a resource for people who want to develop, apply, and teach methods to support health policy using the principles of **robust analytics** or **adaptive management.** It is a guide to material -- concepts, ideas, algorithms, software, commentaries and lessons -- that can support robust analytics. The material is written in R-markdown in a style that could fall anywhere between lecture notes, a user's guide, vignettes that teach a single concept, or commentary. At the top of this page, the [HUB](hub.html) is an easy guide to the content. We don't want this to become a pseudo-journal, so we'll use a chatty tone and to introduce ideas that ought to be handled in greater depth in peer review publications (see the [Style Guide](HARP-Style-Guide.html)).

The core activities of this team are  **R**obust **A**nalytics for **M**alaria **P**olicy (RAMP) and Adaptive Malaria Control. Some of our ideas about robust analytics were published recently in *Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission* [@WuSL2023SpatialDynamics] -- open access online at [PLoS Comp Bio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010684){target="_blank"}. 

In that article, we develop a modular computational framework for malaria simulation modeling to implement some ideas that are at the core of robust analytics. The article includes some new mathematics to ensure models would have the capability of dealing with *parasite dispersal* and *spatial heterogeneity.* A core motivation was that robust analytics should be done at the right level of complexity, so frameworks should facilitate **scalable complexity** to make it possible to extend or elaborate on models. 

The software has been implemented in two software packages: 

+ [exDE: Extensible Differential Equations for Mosquito-Borne Pathogen Modeling](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/){target="_blank"}. 
    
+ [MicroMoB: Microsimulation for mosquito-borne pathogens](https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB/){target="_blank"}. 

We've been working on extending the functionality to include exogenous forcing by weather and malaria control. Check back for some tutorials.
